/**
 * Projects when the Kiro credit plan runs out before its reset (issue #17112).
 *
 * Two inputs, each used for what it can actually say:
 *
 * - The account reading (`used` / `limit` / `resets`) gives the PACE: credits
 *   used this cycle divided by the days the cycle has run. It is the account's
 *   whole spend, every client included.
 * - This gateway's per-day credits (`/api/usage/daily-credits`) give the SHAPE
 *   of a week: how much heavier a Tuesday is than a Sunday. It is NOT used for
 *   the pace, because it only sees turns this gateway ran -- an IDE signed in
 *   to the same account is invisible to it, so projecting from its numbers
 *   would push the run-out date later than the account's real one.
 *
 * Pure: every input, including "now", is a parameter, so the tests pin it.
